# Podcast Admin

Podcast Admin is a light, simple, reliable podcast platform that focuses on high quality audio, team collaboration and actionable analytics.

## Why should you care

- **Easily update intros and outros for all episodes** without configuring every episode individually or mixing each episode again
- **Use your custom website** for RSS feed episode urls
- **Have pre-set intros cross fade into episodes** for a more professional touch
- **Uses raw http request logs** for better statistics
- **Open source**, so you can build the features you're missing everywhere else
- **High quality audio** for better listening experience
- **Markdown show notes** editing for easy formatting 
- **Multiple users** for team work

## Can I see it?

Of course, simply click the link below. But don't expect too much. It works but user experience and user onboarding needs improvements.

## What's the business model

Money is not the focus. We're running a podcast ourselves and wanted this tool because we couldn't find any other podcast platform that could provide us with the features above.

The platform is open source to allow others to contribute and build something together that we couldn't build ourselves.

At some point it probably makes sense to charge a monthly fee for non-contributors to pay for traffic and servers as well as put more focus on development.

## How to contribute

Everyone is invited to contribute. There is no clear plan with no instructions. Simply look at the code, try out the software and create pull requests as you see fit. Then we can take the discussion from there.


### Write code

The project is set up to run out of the box on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).

[Simply click here to start a new workspace.](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/podcast-admin/podcast-admin)

It should automatically start a react development server as well as Firebase emulators. You probably need to install the [Gitpod Local Companion](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/local-app) to mirror all open Gitpod ports to your local machine.

Then you can open (if it hasn't happened automatically) http://localhost:3000 to get to the app as well as http://localhost:4000 to get to all emulators with preset data.

### Technology

The project is a React app that runs on Google Firebase infrastructure.

### What to expect

Don't expect well-written code. It is pretty messy. But this is how every project starts. ;-)
